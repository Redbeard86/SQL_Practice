The Horse table has the following columns:

ID - integer, primary key
RegisteredName - variable-length string
Breed - variable-length string
Height - decimal number
BirthDate - date
Write a SELECT statement to select the registered name and height for only horses that have an above average height. Order the results by height.

-- Your SQL statements go here 
SELECT RegisteredName, Height
From Horse
Where Height > 
   (Select AVG(Height)
   From Horse)
Order BY Height;
