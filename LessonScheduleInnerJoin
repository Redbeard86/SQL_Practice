LAB - Select lesson schedule with inner join
The database has three tables for tracking horse-riding lessons:

Horse with columns:

ID - primary key
RegisteredName
Breed
Height
BirthDate
Student with columns:

ID - primary key
FirstName
LastName
Street
City
State
Zip
Phone
EmailAddress
LessonSchedule with columns:

HorseID - partial primary key, foreign key references Horse(ID)
StudentID - foreign key references Student(ID)
LessonDateTime - partial primary key
Write a SELECT statement to create a lesson schedule with the lesson date/time, horse ID, and the student's first and last names. 
Order the results in ascending order by lesson date/time, then by horse ID. Unassigned lesson times (student ID is NULL) should not appear in the schedule.

-- Your SELECT statement goes here
Select LessonDateTime, HorseID, S.FirstName, S.LastName
From LessonSchedule
Inner Join Student S
On StudentID = S.ID
Order BY LessonDateTime, HorseID;
