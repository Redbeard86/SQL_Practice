The database has three tables for tracking horse-riding lessons:

Horse with columns:

ID - primary key
RegisteredName
Breed
Height
BirthDate
Student with columns:

ID - primary key
FirstName
LastName
Street
City
State
Zip
Phone
EmailAddress
LessonSchedule with columns:

HorseID - partial primary key, foreign key references Horse(ID)
StudentID - foreign key references Student(ID)
LessonDateTime - partial primary key
Write a SELECT statement to create a lesson schedule for Feb 1, 2020 with the lesson date/time, student's first and last names, and the horse's registered name. 
Order the results in ascending order by lesson date/time, then by the horse's registered name. Make sure unassigned lesson times (student ID is NULL) appear in the results.

-- Your SELECT statement goes here
Select LessonDateTime, S.FirstName, S.Lastname, H.RegisteredName
From LessonSchedule
Left Join Student S
On StudentID = S.ID
Inner Join Horse H
On HorseID = H.ID
Where Date(LessonDateTime) = '2020-02-01'
Order By LessonDateTime, H.RegisteredName;
